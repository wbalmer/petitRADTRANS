## [3.1.0] - 2024-10-01
### Highlights
- Implementation of cloud fraction to model spectra with partial cloud coverage.
- Implementation of convolution with variable width kernel.
- New modelling options: simple circumplanetary disk, SiO clouds, vertically variable fseds, and more!
- New tutorial: using `SpectralModel` with one or several JWST data.
- New function `chemistry.mass_fractions2metallicity` to calculate atmospheric metallicity and element-to-hydrogen ratios from mass fractions.

- Fixed numerous crashes and edge-cases incorrect behaviours.

### Added
- Full integration of partial cloud coverage in `Radtrans`, with the possibility to select on which clouds to apply the partial coverage (affect the cloud opacities, the opaque cloud, and the power law opacities).
- Function to convolve a spectrum with a variable width kernel, based on Brewster implementation. Can be used in a retrieval if the `data_resolution` parameter is set as an array.
- Emission models for retrievals can now include a simple circumplanetary disk model, given blackbody temperature and disk radius parameters.
- Equilibrium mass fraction support for SiO clouds in `chemistry.clouds`.
- Possibility to use vertically variable fsed per species.
- Possibility to run pRT's retrieval model with emcee (base implementation with less functionality than the full retrieval package, i.e., no plotting support for result analysis).
- Possibility to custom `SpectralModel` spectral modification functions at instantiation.
- Possibility to instantiate `SpectralModel` objects with shared opacities with the `from_radtrans` function.
- Possibility to load line-by-line opacities with different frequency grid boundaries.
- Possibility to load any crystalline cloud opacities without giving the space group if there is only one space group available for this cloud species.

- Function to get a forward model(s) of a retrieval, with option to get the best fit model or the Xth quantile model.
- Function to directly get retrieval samples into a dict.
- Function to convert the default log-likelihood to a chi2.
- Documentation for the newly added functions.
- Tutorial for using `SpectralModel` with JWST data.

### Changed
- Future: parameter `emission_geometry` is canonically renamed `irradiation_geometry`. The old parameter will be deprecated in version 4.0.0.

- Clarified a bit the documentation on the `SpectralModel` retrieval framework.
- Requested input and output parameter names for externally provided function to load opacities for `format2petitradtrans`: since cm^2 should be returned it should be called cross-sections, not opacities.
- The `examples` directory is relocated to the notebook directory, and renamed `retrievals`.
- Restructured `retrieval.models.py` to reduce code reuse. New functions to generically compute an emission or transmission spectrum with patchy clouds/hazes.
- Previous 'patchy' model functions are now redundant, all the functions can accept the same patchy cloud parameters. Still included for backwards compatibility.

### Removed
- Unused test functions.
