and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [3.0.0] - 2024-04-29
### Added
- Automatic download of missing input_data files.
- Automatic binning-down of correlated-k opacities when instantiating a `Radtrans` object.
- Simple transit light loss modelling for `SpectralModel`.
- Possibility to retrieve or optimize uncertainties.
- Trimming preparation function.
- Module `cli.prt_cli` to automatically download petitRADTRANS input data files.
- Module `configuration` to manage paths.
- Module `plotlib` to store useful plot functions and plot styles.
- Module `stallar_spectra`, to handle stellar spectra calculations.
- Function `utils.feature_scaling` to normalize arrays.
- Function `utils.bayes_factor2sigma` to convert Bayes factor significance into "sigma" significance.
- Function `SpectralModel.resolving_space` to generate arrays with values spaced at constant resolving power.
- Function `chemistry.utils.fill_atmospheric_layer` to fill an atmospheric layer using weighted filling species.
- Function `retrieval.retrieval.save_best_fit_outputs_external_variability` to speed up calculations, since it makes use of `external_prt_reference` properly.
- Function that generates the petitRADTRANS default wavelength grid.
- Constant `e_molar_mass` to physical constants.
- SysRem preparing pipeline.
- Arguments of `SpectralModel.calculate_spectrum` in `model_parameters`.
- MgFeSiO4 cloud mass fraction calculation.
- Object `SpectralModel` support for models of any complexity.
- More control over uncertainty_scaling_b: can now also be done per observation "types" (e.g., different MRS channels see the same b).
- Possibility for the forward model to return flux of different atmospheric columns, which are then mixed with the atmospheric_column_flux_mixer function given to the data object, depending on the data's epoch and exposure time.
- Possibility to return only the best fit spectra are calculated and no plot is produced.
- Possibility to return the gases and clouds opacities calculated by the `Radtrans` object.
- Possibility to initialize a `Radtrans` object with CIA opacities, cloud opacities, or no opacities.
- Possibility to print the log-likelihood to the console if desired, for retrieval debugging.
- Possibility for function `retrieval.retrieval.save_best_fit_outputs` to return the best fit spectra.
- Possibility to set the clouds particles porosity factor.
- Treatment to allow for concatenated fluxes (from different epochs) for variability retrievals.
  (see `concatenate_flux_epochs_variability` and its use in the data class).
- Handling of column flux mixing in `retrieval.retrieval.save_best_fit_outputs`.
- Some helpful error and warning messages.
- Argument `seed` to function `Retrieval.run`, for reproducibility.
- Better test suite workflow.
- Module `docs/utils` to store functions useful to build the docs.

### Changed
- Added column_flux_mixer treatment to petitRADTRANS/retrieval/data.py's get_chisq() in convolve-rebin mode.
- TODO: `fortran_radtrans_core.math.solve_tridiagonal_system`:
  - temporarily reverted to allow < 0 solutions in the tridiagonal solver until it is determined if they should be allowed.
  - temporarily silented the overflow warning message until a solution to trigger the message less often is found.
- Functions, arguments and attributes now have clearer names and respect PEP8. The complete list of change is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yCiyPJfUXzsd9gWTt3HdwntNM2MrHNfaZoacXkg1KLk/edit#gid=2092634402).
- Spectral functions of `Radtrans` (`calculate_flux` and `calculate_transit_radii`) now return wavelengths, spectrum, and a dictionary containing additional outputs, instead of nothing.
- Function `Radtrans.calculate_flux` now output by default wavelengths in cm (instead of frequencies in Hz) and flux in erg.s-1.cm-2/cm instead of erg.s-1.cm-2/Hz. Setting the argument `frequencies_to_wavelengths=False` restores the previous behaviour.
- Function `Radtrans.calculate_transit_radii` now output by default wavelengths in cm (instead of frequencies in Hz). Setting the argument `frequencies_to_wavelengths=False` restores the previous behaviour.
- Complete rework of the input_data file naming convention.
- The combination of correlated-k opacities are now using the faster merge sorting algorithm.
- Significantly improved the CIA interpolation performances. This might cause small changes in some results (most of the time the relative change should be < 1e-6).
- Significantly improved transmission spectra calculation performances.
- Significantly improved the `polyfit` preparing pipeline performances by using `numpy.polyfit` instead of the recommended `numpy.polynomial.Polynomial.fit`.
- Slightly improved Feautrier radiative transfer calculation performances (`calculate_flux`).
- Improved memory usage of object `Radtrans`.
- Object `Radtrans` is now imported using `from petitRADTRANS.radtrans import Radtrans` (was `from petitRADTRANS import Radtrans`) for more stable installation.
- Object `SpectralModel` is now imported using `from petitRADTRANS.spectral_model import SpectralModel`.
- Object `Planet` is now imported using `from petitRADTRANS.planet import Planet`.
- Module `nat_cst` renamed `physical_constants`.
- Module `poor_mans_nonequ_chem` renamed `chemistry.pre_calculated_chemistry` and reworked.
- Module `phoenix` renamed `stellar_spectra.phoenix` and reworked.
- Some functions have moved from the module `physical_constants` to another, more specific module.
- Some functions have moved from the module `Radtrans` to another, more specific module.
- Input data path is now stored in a config file within the folder \<HOME\>/.petitRADTRANS, generated when installing the package or using it for the first time.
- Attribute `SpectralModel.times` is now inside `SpectralModel.model_parameters`.
- Function `polyfit` now only masks invalid points instead of the entire column/line where the point was.
- In `SpectralModel`, orbital longitudes and radial velocity semi-amplitudes are know calculated instead of fixed.
- In function `retrievals.data.get_chisq`, variable `scale_err` is now applied after 10^b error scaling, not before.

- Function `chemistry.volume_mixing_ratios2mass_fractions` always returning an empty dict.
- Zero opacity values in k-tables creating NaNs when using `exo-k` to bin them down.
- Emission scattering mode impacting transmission spectra (slight change in the result).
- Oscillating telluric lines depth when generating shifted and re-binned mock observations with `SpectralModel`.
- Too strict relevance threshold when combining correlated-k opacities.
- Debugging text displayed in the `Radtrans` photospheric radius calculation.
- Incorrect behaviour: importing the chemical table triggers its loading.
