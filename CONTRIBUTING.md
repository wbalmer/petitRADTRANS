# Contributing to petitRADTRANS
## Reporting issues
We always aim to enhance petitRADTRANS, so do not hesitate to report bugs or propose new features or other suggestions. The preferred way in both cases is to create a [new issue](https://gitlab.com/mauricemolli/petitRADTRANS/-/issues).

When reporting issues please include as much detail as possible about your operating system, petitRADTRANS version and python version. Whenever possible, please also include a brief, self-contained code example that demonstrates the problem. Please carefully read the guidelines in the [documentation](https://petitradtrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/contributing.html#suggestions-and-reporting-issues).

**While reporting the issue on Gitlab is the preferred method**, as it makes the issue public and thus can help other users to solve it, you can also directly contact members of the development team via [e-mail](https://petitradtrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#contact), if you would like some help with modelling, for example.

## Contributing code or adding opacities
We welcome contributions to petitRADTRANS! If you want to contribute a new capability to the code, especially if it is something more involved, please notify the development team before. This is such that we can gauge whether your contribution can or should be merged into pRT.

More details are available in the [documentation](https://petitradtrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/contributing.html#contribute-code).
