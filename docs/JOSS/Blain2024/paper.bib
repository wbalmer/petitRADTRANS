    abstract = "{We present the most detailed data-driven exploration of cloud opacity in a substellar object to-date. We have tested over 60 combinations of cloud composition and structure, particle-size distribution, scattering model, and gas phase composition assumptions against archival 1–15 μm spectroscopy for the unusually red L4.5 dwarf 2MASSW J2224438-015852 using the Brewster retrieval framework. We find that, within our framework, a model that includes enstatite and quartz cloud layers at shallow pressures, combined with a deep iron cloud deck fits the data best. This model assumes a Hansen distribution for particle sizes for each cloud, and Mie scattering. We retrieved particle effective radii of \\$\\log \_\\{10\\} a \\{\\rm (\\mu m)\\} = -1.41^\\{+0.18\\}\_\\{-0.17\\}\\$ for enstatite, \\$-0.44^\\{+0.04\\}\_\\{-0.20\\}\\$ for quartz, and \\$-0.77^\\{+0.05\\}\_\\{-0.06\\}\\$ for iron. Our inferred cloud column densities suggest \\$\\{\\rm (Mg/Si)\\} = 0.69^\\{+0.06\\}\_\\{-0.08\\}\\$ if there are no other sinks for magnesium or silicon. Models that include forsterite alongside, or in place of, these cloud species are strongly rejected in favour of the above combination. We estimate a radius of 0.75 ± 0.02 RJup, which is considerably smaller than predicted by evolutionary models for a field age object with the luminosity of 2M2224-0158. Models which assume vertically constant gas fractions are consistently preferred over models that assume thermochemical equilibrium. From our retrieved gas fractions, we infer \\$\\{\\rm [M/H]\\} = +0.38^\\{+0.07\\}\_\\{-0.06\\}\\$ and \\$\\{\\rm C/O\\} = 0.83^\\{+0.06\\}\_\\{-0.07\\}\\$. Both these values are towards the upper end of the stellar distribution in the Solar neighbourhood, and are mutually consistent in this context. A composition towards the extremes of the local distribution is consistent with this target being an outlier in the ultracool dwarf population.}",

The present paper presents a very general method for obtaining topological order. It permits treatment of larger networks than can be handled on present procedures and achieves this with greater efficiency. Although the procedure can be adapted to any machine, it is discussed in terms of the 7090. A PERT network of 30,000 activities can be ordered in less than one hour of machine time. The method was developed as a byproduct of procedure needed by Westinghouse, Baltimore. It has not been programmed and at present there are no plans to implement it. In regard to the techniques described, Westinghouse's present and anticipated needs are completely served by the Lockheed program, which is in current use.},

    abstract = "{Interpretations of exoplanetary transmission spectra have been undermined by apparent obscuration due to clouds/hazes. Debate rages on whether weak H2O features seen in exoplanet spectra are due to clouds or inherently depleted oxygen. Assertions of solar H2O abundances have relied on making a priori model assumptions, for example, chemical/radiative equilibrium. In this work, we attempt to address this problem with a new retrieval paradigm for transmission spectra. We introduce poseidon, a two-dimensional atmospheric retrieval algorithm including generalized inhomogeneous clouds. We demonstrate that this prescription allows one to break vital degeneracies between clouds and prominent molecular abundances. We apply poseidon to the best transmission spectrum presently available, for the hot Jupiter HD 209458b, uncovering new insights into its atmosphere at the day–night terminator. We extensively explore the parameter space with an unprecedented 108 models, spanning the continuum from fully cloudy to cloud-free atmospheres, in a fully Bayesian retrieval framework. We report the first detection of nitrogen chemistry (NH3 and/or HCN) in an exoplanet atmosphere at 3.7–7.7σ confidence, non-uniform cloud coverage at 4.5–5.4σ, high-altitude hazes at \\&gt;3σ and sub-solar H2O at ≳3–5σ, depending on the assumed cloud distribution. We detect NH3 at 3.3σ, and 4.9σ for fully cloudy and cloud-free scenarios, respectively. For the model with the highest Bayesian evidence, we constrain H2O at 5–15 ppm (0.01–0.03) × solar and NH3 at 0.01–2.7 ppm, strongly suggesting disequilibrium chemistry and cautioning against equilibrium assumptions. Our results herald a new promise for retrieving cloudy atmospheres using high-precision Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope spectra.}",

	abstract = {We present the easy-to-use, publicly available, Python package petitRADTRANS, built for the spectral characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. The code is fast, accurate, and versatile; it can calculate both transmission and emission spectra within a few seconds at low resolution (λ/∆λ = 1000; correlated-k method) and high resolution (λ/∆λ = 106; line-by-line method), using only a few lines of input instruction. The somewhat slower, correlated-k method is used at low resolution because it is more accurate than methods such as opacity sampling. Clouds can be included and treated using wavelength-dependent power law opacities, or by using optical constants of real condensates, specifying either the cloud particle size, or the atmospheric mixing and particle settling strength. Opacities of amorphous or crystalline, spherical or irregularly-shaped cloud particles are available. The line opacity database spans temperatures between 80 and 3000 K, allowing to model ﬂuxes of objects such as terrestrial planets, super-Earths, Neptunes, or hot Jupiters , if their atmospheres are hydrogen-dominated. Higher temperature points and species will be added in the future, allowing to also model the class of ultra hot-Jupiters, with equilibrium temperatures Teq 2000 K. Radiative transfer results were tested by cross-verifying the low- and high-resolution implementation of petitRADTRANS, and benchmarked with the petitCODE, which itself is also benchmarked to the ATMO and Exo-REM codes. We successfully carried out test retrievals of synthetic JWST emission and transmission spectra (for the hot Jupiter TrES-4b, which has a Teq of ∼1800 K).},

abstract = {We have developed an online radiative-transfer suite (https://psg.gsfc.nasa.gov) applicable to a broad range of planetary objects (e.g., planets, moons, comets, asteroids, TNOs, KBOs, exoplanets). The Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) can synthesize planetary spectra (atmospheres and surfaces) for a broad range of wavelengths (UV/Vis/near-IR/IR/far-IR/THz/sub-mm/Radio) from any observatory (e.g., JWST, ALMA, Keck, SOFIA), any orbiter (e.g., ExoMars, Juno), or any lander (e.g., MSL). This is achieved by combining several state-of-the-art radiative transfer models, spectroscopic databases and planetary databases (i.e., climatological and orbital). PSG has a 3D (three-dimensional) orbital calculator for most bodies in the solar system, and all confirmed exoplanets, while the radiative-transfer models can ingest billions of spectral signatures for hundreds of species from several spectroscopic repositories. It integrates the latest radiative-transfer and scattering methods in order to compute high resolution spectra via line-by-line calculations, and utilizes the efficient correlated-k method at moderate resolutions, while for computing cometary spectra, PSG handles non-LTE and LTE excitation processes. PSG includes a realistic noise calculator that integrates several telescope/instrument configurations (e.g., interferometry, coronagraphs) and detector technologies (e.g., CCD, heterodyne detectors, bolometers). Such an integration of advanced spectroscopic methods into an online tool can greatly serve the planetary community, ultimately enabling the retrieval of planetary parameters from remote sensing data, efficient mission planning strategies, interpretation of current and future planetary data, calibration of spectroscopic data, and development of new instrument/spacecraft concepts.}
