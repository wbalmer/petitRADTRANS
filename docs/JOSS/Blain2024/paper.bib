abstract = {Topological Sorting is a procedure required for many problems involving analysis of networks. An example of one such problem is PERT. The present paper presents a very general method for obtaining topological order. It permits treatment of larger networks than can be handled on present procedures and achieves this with greater efficiency. Although the procedure can be adapted to any machine, it is discussed in terms of the 7090. A PERT network of 30,000 activities can be ordered in less than one hour of machine time. The method was developed as a byproduct of procedure needed by Westinghouse, Baltimore. It has not been programmed and at present there are no plans to implement it. In regard to the techniques described, Westinghouse's present and anticipated needs are completely served by the Lockheed program, which is in current use.},

	abstract = {We present the easy-to-use, publicly available, Python package petitRADTRANS, built for the spectral characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. The code is fast, accurate, and versatile; it can calculate both transmission and emission spectra within a few seconds at low resolution (λ/∆λ = 1000; correlated-k method) and high resolution (λ/∆λ = 106; line-by-line method), using only a few lines of input instruction. The somewhat slower, correlated-k method is used at low resolution because it is more accurate than methods such as opacity sampling. Clouds can be included and treated using wavelength-dependent power law opacities, or by using optical constants of real condensates, specifying either the cloud particle size, or the atmospheric mixing and particle settling strength. Opacities of amorphous or crystalline, spherical or irregularly-shaped cloud particles are available. The line opacity database spans temperatures between 80 and 3000 K, allowing to model ﬂuxes of objects such as terrestrial planets, super-Earths, Neptunes, or hot Jupiters , if their atmospheres are hydrogen-dominated. Higher temperature points and species will be added in the future, allowing to also model the class of ultra hot-Jupiters, with equilibrium temperatures Teq 2000 K. Radiative transfer results were tested by cross-verifying the low- and high-resolution implementation of petitRADTRANS, and benchmarked with the petitCODE, which itself is also benchmarked to the ATMO and Exo-REM codes. We successfully carried out test retrievals of synthetic JWST emission and transmission spectra (for the hot Jupiter TrES-4b, which has a Teq of ∼1800 K).},
