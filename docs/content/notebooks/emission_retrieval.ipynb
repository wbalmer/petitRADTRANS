    "# Retrievals: Emission Spectra Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "This retrieval is based on Mollière+20 for HR8799e, and shows a more realistic example of how to set up a retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, the module poor_mans_noneq_chemistry is used to solve disequilibrium chemistry, and the cloud_cond module is used for condensation. You can import other models from models.py, or write your own function, ensuring that it takes in the same set of inputs and outputs, which are documented in models, see the [API documentation](../../autoapi/petitRADTRANS/retrieval/models/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This model uses a simple adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) algorithm to improve the pressure resolution around the location of the cloud bases.\n"

    "You should already have an installation of pRT on your machine, please see the [installation manual](../installation.html) if you have not installed it yet. \n",
    "[pyMultiNest](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest) is also required. [Ultranest](https://johannesbuchner.github.io/UltraNest/index.html) is required if you want to use that as your sampler rather than pyMultiNest. See the Ultranest documentation for why you might want to choose this method.\n",
    "Using nested sampling rather than MCMC is faster, handles multimodal cases better, and directly provides the Bayesian evidence, which allows for easier model comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will outline the process of setting up a RetrievalConfig object, which is the class used to set up a pRT retrieval.\n",
    "The basic process will always be to set up the configuration, and then pass it to the Retrieval class to run the retrieval using pyMultiNest.\n",
    "Several standard plotting outputs will also be produced by the retrieval class.\n",
    "Most of the classes and functions used in this tutorial have more advanced features than what will be explained here, so it's highly recommended to take a look at the code and API documentation. \n",
    "There should be enough flexibility built in to cover most typical retrieval studies, but if you have feature requests please get in touch, or open an issue on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/mauricemolli/petitRADTRANS.git).\n",
