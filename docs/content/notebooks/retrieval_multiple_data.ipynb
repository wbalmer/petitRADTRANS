    "\n",
    "You can also set a distance to your object, which will allow you to automatically scale the flux and error of your data using the `scale_to_distance()` method - useful if you have data normalized to 10pc! Finally, there's also a arguments `scale`, `scale_err` and `offset_bool`, which tells the retrieval that the flux or uncertaines should be scaled by an arbitrary multiplicative factor or have an additive offset, both which is set up as a normal retrieval parameter using the `RetrivalConfig.add_parameter()` method. \n",

    "Notice that we're also telling the retrieval that we want the data of Order 2 to have an additive offset: this will allow the data to float relative to Order 1, which remains fixed. This can be used to compensate for differences in transit depth between different instruments.\n",

This way we only need to compute the spectrum once in the same wavelength range, rather than having the retrieval package initialise two `Radtrans` objects and calculating a spectrum for each. This saves both memory and time. However, be careful here: the model resolution in the reference object should be high enough to properly sample any datasets that reference it!\n",

In the special case here the SOSS data files are binned to R = 100. Thus, while the spectrum was indeed recorded at R=700, it is OK to use a lower pRT model resolution for the retrievals.*"
