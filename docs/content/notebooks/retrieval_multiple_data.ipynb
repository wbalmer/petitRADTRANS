    "As mentioned, the Data class is arguably the most important part of setting up the retrieval.\n",
    "Not only do you input your data here, but you also choose your model function and resolution. \n",
    "This means that you can design a retrieval around different datatypes and retrieve simultaneously on both - for example, if you want the day and nightside of a planet, or want to combine the eastward and westward limbs of a transmission spectrum with different models. \n",
    "New in version 3.1: you can now set the `data_resolution` as an array. For many instruments, such as those on JWST, the spectral resolution varies with wavelength. In order to more accurately capture this, you can now pass an array with the spectral resolution at each wavelength, which determines the width of the Gaussian kernel convolved with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also set a distance to your object, which will allow you to automatically scale the flux and error of your data using the `scale_to_distance()` method - useful if you have data normalized to 10pc! Finally, there's also a arguments `scale`, `scale_err` and `offset_bool`, which tells the retrieval that the flux or uncertaines should be scaled by an arbitrary multiplicative factor or have an additive offset, both which is set up as a normal retrieval parameter using the `RetrivalConfig.add_parameter()` method. \n",
    "The name must be of the format DATANAME_scale_factor or DATANAME_offset. \n",
    "This is useful if two datasets are incompatible in absolute photometry, but you still want to use the spectral shape to inform the retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this retrieval we're going to include several datasets from different JWST instruments, starting with NIRISS SOSS orders 1 and 2. \n",
    "To include both of them , we simply add more than one dataset to our `RetrievalConfig` object. \n",
    "Notice that we're also telling the retrieval that we want the data of Order 2 to have an additive offset: this will allow the data to float relative to Order 1, which remains fixed. This can be used to compensate for differences in transit depth between different instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also using the built-in `guillot_transmission` model for this retrieval, rather than writing our own model function from scratch."

This way we only need to compute the spectrum once in the same wavelength range, rather than having the retrieval package initialise two `Radtrans` objects and calculating a spectrum for each. This saves both memory and time. However, be careful here: the model resolution in the reference object should be high enough to properly sample any datasets that reference it!\n",
    "If you have multiple data sets that do not overlap, but lie back-to-back to each other in wavelength space, with at most small gaps, it makes also sense to use external references, since it reduced computational overheads.\n",

In the special case here the SOSS data files are binned to R = 100. Thus, while the spectrum was indeed recorded at R=700, it is OK to use a lower pRT model resolution for the retrievals.*"
