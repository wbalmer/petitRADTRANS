class SpectralModel(Radtrans):
    r"""Extension of the Radtrans object. Used to construct custom spectral models.

    The parameters required for the Radtrans spectral functions are calculated from "model functions", which require
    "model parameters". All parameters are calculated in order thanks to a topological sorting algorithm. Looping
    dependencies are not supported by default.

    Spectra can be generated with the calculate_spectrum function. Several spectral modification functions are
    available.

    A Data object can be initialised with the init_data function, which can then be used to generate a Retrieval object
    with the Retrieval.from_data function.

    Some features are detailed below.

    Automatic wavelength boundaries calculation:
        The model wavelength boundaries can be determined from the rebinned_wavelengths model parameter, taking into
        account Doppler shift if necessary, using the following model parameters (see below for a description):
            - relative_velocities
            - system_observer_radial_velocities
            - is_orbiting
            - orbital_longitudes
            - orbital_phases
            - rest_frame_velocity_shift
            - radial_velocity_semi_amplitude
        The size of the arrays is used to generate multiple observations of the spectrum. For example, if n_phases
        orbital phases are given, the generated spectrum of size n_wavelengths is shifted according to the relative
        velocity at each orbital phase. This generates a time-dependent spectrum of shape (n_phases, n_wavelengths).

    Custom functions and kwargs:
        The compute_* functions can be rewritten in scripts if necessary. Functions calculate_* should not be
        rewritten. Custom functions *must* include the **kwargs argument, even if it is not used. This is by design,
        to allow for any model parameter to be used with an arbitrarily complex custom function.

    Default model parameters:
        Default model parameters used when calling the SpectralModel built-in functions. This list may change when
        using custom functions.
        Radtrans spectral parameters can also be used as model parameters (see next section).

    Args:
        pressures:
            (bar) array containing the pressures of the model, from lowest to highest.
        line_species:
            list of strings, denoting which line absorber species to include; must match the opacity file names.
        rayleigh_species:
            list of strings, denoting which Rayleigh scattering species to include; must match the opacity file
            names.
        continuum_opacities:
            list of strings, denoting which continuum absorber species to include; must match the opacity file
            names.
        cloud_species:
            list of strings, denoting which cloud opacity species to include; must match the opacity file names.
        line_opacity_mode:
            if equal to ``'c-k'``: use low-resolution mode, at
            :math:`\\lambda/\\Delta \\lambda = 1000`, with the correlated-k
            assumption. if equal to ``'lbl'``: use high-resolution mode, at
            :math:`\\lambda/\\Delta \\lambda = 10^6`, with a line-by-line
            treatment.
        scattering_in_emission:
            Will be ``False`` by default.
            If ``True`` scattering will be included in the emission spectral
            calculations. Note that this increases the runtime of pRT!
        line_by_line_opacity_sampling:
            Will be ``None`` by default. If integer positive value, and if
            ``mode == 'lbl'`` is ``True``, then this will only consider every
            line_by_line_opacity_sampling-nth point of the high-resolution opacities.
            This may be desired in the case where medium-resolution spectra are
            required with a :math:`\\lambda/\\Delta \\lambda > 1000`, but much smaller than
            :math:`10^6`, which is the resolution of the ``lbl`` mode. In this case it
            may make sense to carry out the calculations with line_by_line_opacity_sampling = 10,
            for example, and then re-binning to the final desired resolution:
            this may save time! The user should verify whether this leads to
            solutions which are identical to the re-binned results of the fiducial
            :math:`10^6` resolution. If not, this parameter must not be used.
        temperatures:
            array containing the temperatures of the model, at each pressure.

            (um) wavelengths of the model.

            transit radii of the model.

            scale:
                If True, modify the spectrum according to the ``scale_spectrum`` function.
                By default, scale with respect to ``star_observed_spectrum`` (in emission), or ``star_radius``
                (in transmission).
            shift:
                If True, modify the spectrum according to the ``shift_wavelengths`` function.
                By default, Doppler-shift the spectrum according to ``relative_velocities``
            use_transit_light_loss:
                If True, modify the spectrum according to the ``compute_transit_fractional_light_loss`` function.
                By default, apply Eq. 1 of Mandel & Agol, 2002 (https://www.doi.org/10.1086/345520). Limb darkening is
                not taken into account.
            convolve:
                If True, modify the spectrum according to the ``convolve`` function.
                By default, convolve the function with a Gaussian kernel of FWHM determined by
                ``convolve_resolving_power``.
            rebin:
                If True, modify the spectrum according to the ``rebin_spectrum`` function.
                By default, rebin the spectrum from its native wavelengths to ``rebinned_wavelengths``.
            prepare:
                If True, modify the spectrum according to the ``preparing_pipeline```function.
                By default, prepare the spectrum using the ``polyfit`` preparing pipeline. Intended for
                ground-based high-resolution forward models.
            return_additional_outputs:
                If True, return the ``Radtrans`` additional outputs.
        Returns:
            Wavelengths (cm) and spectra (cm in transmission, erg.cm-2.s-1/cm in emission), for each order, exposure,
            and wavelength. If ``return_additional_outputs`` is True, also return a dict containing additional outputs.
